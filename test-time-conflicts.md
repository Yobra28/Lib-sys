# Enhanced Seat Booking Time Conflict Detection - Test Scenarios

## Overview
The enhanced seat booking system now supports:
1. **Custom time range selection** - Users can specify any start and end time
2. **Advanced conflict detection** - Prevents overlapping bookings with detailed information
3. **Visual indicators** - Shows which seats are available vs already booked
4. **Detailed reservation info** - Displays who has booked conflicting time slots

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Time Conflict Prevention
**Setup**: Seat A-009 is booked from 7:00-10:00 by User A
**Test**: User B tries to book the same seat from 8:00-11:00
**Expected Result**: ❌ Booking rejected - "Seat is already reserved for this time slot"

### Scenario 2: Adjacent Time Slots (Should Work)
**Setup**: Seat A-009 is booked from 7:00-10:00 by User A  
**Test**: User B tries to book the same seat from 10:00-13:00
**Expected Result**: ✅ Booking allowed - No time overlap

### Scenario 3: Partial Overlap Detection
**Setup**: Seat A-009 is booked from 7:00-10:00 by User A
**Test**: User B tries to book the same seat from 9:30-12:30
**Expected Result**: ❌ Booking rejected - Overlapping time detected

### Scenario 4: Multiple Reservations Same Seat
**Setup**: 
- Seat A-009: 7:00-10:00 (User A), 10:00-13:00 (User B), 13:00-16:00 (User C)
**Test**: User D tries to book 8:00-11:00
**Expected Result**: ❌ Booking rejected - Conflicts with User A's reservation

### Scenario 5: Custom Time Range Search
**Test**: Search for seats available from 9:30-11:45
**Expected Result**: ✅ Returns only seats with no reservations during 9:30-11:45
